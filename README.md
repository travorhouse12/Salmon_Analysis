The storyboard for the Dashboard can be located on the Google Slides draft as well as in the SB folder on the main branch. 

EXTRA INFORMATION ON THE DASHBOARD SECTION

- The blue print for the storyboard is just a mockup. There may be more on the storyboard then really will be completed for the dashboard. The more ideas the easier the process will be to complete it.

- There will be a seperate storyboard/presentation created through Tableau as well as the app.

- A JSON file was created from the preprocess CSV which you can find the code and the JSON file in the JSON folder above. Another JSON file will be created now that the ML is finished.
